## [[2022.04.21] Notes on GraphMat and Graphicionado](http://blog.jpramos.me/2022.04.21)
> I've recently been working on graph analytic algorithms, or well the optimization of graph algorithms. While working with my current research group ([CAPRA](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu)) I've been trying to understand our [Calyx compiler infrastructure](calyxir.org). What's a better way to learn a language than by using it to implement [a very unintuitive research paper](https://mrmgroup.cs.princeton.edu/papers/taejun_micro16.pdf)? I go into details of what exactly is Graphicionado —*in simple terms*—  a graph algorithm optimization framework using hardware.

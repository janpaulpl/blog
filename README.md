    [2022.06.28] What is Gradual Verification?
  </a>
</h2>

> Formal verification is a program correctness and soundness verification method that is near and dear to my heart. However, recently I've been working on a research project involving Gradual Verification! Introduced by <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/papers/vmcai2018-gradual-verification.pdf" style="color: #364491; border-bottom:1px dotted">Bader et al. [2018]</a>, GV seeks to use both static and dynamic program verification and make use of their isolated advantages, inspired by gradual typing. I explain at a somewhat high level what GV is technically, why we should care about it, and current systems tools for GV.

    [2022.04.21] A brief explanation of GraphMat and Graphicionado
  </a>

> I've recently been working on graph analytic algorithms, or well the optimization of graph algorithms. While working with my current research group (<a href="https://capra.cs.cornell.edu" style="color: #364491; border-bottom:1px dotted">CAPRA</a>) I've been trying to understand our <a href="calyxir.org" style="color: #364491; border-bottom:1px dotted">Calyx compiler infrastructure</a>. What's a better way to learn a language than by using it to implement <a href="https://mrmgroup.cs.princeton.edu/papers/taejun_micro16.pdf" style="color: #364491; border-bottom:1px dotted">a very unintuitive research paper</a>? I go into detail about what exactly Graphicionado is —*in simple terms*—  a graph algorithm optimization framework using hardware.
